        <h3 style="font-size: 25px;">A little about myself....</h3>
        <br /> <br />
        <h3 style="font-size: 25px;">I love guitar,video games,photography, and comedy &#127928 &#127918</h3>
    <div class="list">
        <p style="font-size: 25px;">My mother used to be a guitarist back in her days, playing at various</p>
        <p style="font-size: 25px;">occasions.Since I've had this unknown love for guitar and music in general,</p>
        <p style="font-size: 25px;">it is natural that her legacy has been passed on to me. It was meant to be. </p>
        <p style="font-size: 25px;">As for video games,I used to be obsessed with them since i was a child. </p>
        <p style="font-size: 25px;">Since then i've always been fascinated by technology. In fact,</p>
        <p style="font-size: 25px;">I actually chose Computer Science because my sister told me "Since you're so good at</p>
        <p style="font-size: 25px;">computers, why don't you go for Computer Science?". And the rest is history.&#128522 </p>
        <p style="font-size: 25px;">And lastly, I love capturing photographs of the landscapes, especially symmetry in nature.</p>
    </div>
    <p style="font-size: 25px;">I love comedy shows, and my favourite show is The Office.</p>
    <br />
    <h3 style="font-size: 25px;">My Future &#128640;</h3>
    <div class="list">
        <p style="font-size: 25px;"> My future hopefully will be surrounded by game developers as my dream is to</p>
        <p style="font-size: 25px;">help develop games that I love playing so much.</p>
